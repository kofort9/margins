The purpose of Howard.edu is to serve as a hub for everything Howard University. The website provides links
that keeps current and prospective students, faculty and staff, Alumni, and parents updated and informed. 
For students, the website provides a link to a page that gives information about upcoming deadlines, and links 
to important websites that current students often visit. Faculty and staff also have a page it another set of links
that are very similar to the current students page but they also provide instructions on how to perform professor related 
task. It is also provided with a directory for different resources for support services. The home page is very aesthetically 
pleasing. It’s mainly geared towards attracting prospective students and frequently visited from alumni. The first 
three links provided are for donating, scheduling a tour of the school, and applying to the school. If scroll down 
the page a little bit one will see a preview of what some of the faulty and students are currently working on with 
links to a pop-up that will tell their story. After a look at some of the people at howard there is a section for general 
news about the school with pictures and links to the full story. News is followed by currently and upcoming athletic events. 
Then finally links and preview of some of Howard’s social media pages. This is this is great marketing. The website has 
good functionality, sadly only the homepage is interactive it has pictures, videos and other dynamic elements that make the 
home page visually appealing. Overall one might give the website a 9 out of 10.
