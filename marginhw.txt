Assumptions:
	- margins length are read in from the text file 
 	- 1 line = 80 characters
 	- left and right margin are equal positive integers
 	- output is 1 paragraph
 	- total margin length < line length

Algorithm:

 	- declare line length
 	- declare margin length
 	- get file name
 	- open file (input)
 	- open output file ("DAT1.txt")
 	- get margin integers
    - calculate remaining line length, given margins
 	- read in words from input file
 	- store words in list
 	- for words in list
 	- format the word 
   	- add word to formatted string
	- add formatted string to the full string 
   	- subtract word length from line length
   	- move runoff words to next line
 	- close both files
